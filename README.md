This is Currently A work in progress!
This system uses a 3d printed funnel-totter system to collect & dump rain water. As the bucket fills and tips, a hall sensor records the action and incraments the counter. At a user specified interval, WiFi is activated and data is posted to the API.
My version runs on solar power away from the farm. A better update would be to go even lower power and fully intagrate the solar on the module. Dumping WiFi in favor of LoRA is a much better option
API is built on Node-Red with graphing built with Grafana. 
To Do:
- More testing of desing and algo
- Upload of Node-Red web server APIs + MysqlDB + Grafana UI

Free to use and contribute to! The design was a fork from someone else's project long ago. I made several mods in tinkercad to make it easy to print with no external pieces.
Print With Supports!!!
RR_Full_DoNotPrint.stl is just to show how the pieces fit. This is unprintable.
